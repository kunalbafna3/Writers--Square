          <h6>THE BOY WHO LIVED</h6>
          <p class="card-text1">
            M r. and Mrs. Dursley, of number four, Privet Drive, were proud to say
            that they were perfectly normal, thank you very much. They were the last people
            you’d expect to be involved in anything strange or mysterious, because they just
            didn’t hold with such nonsense.
            Mr. Dursley was the director of a firm called Grunnings, which made
            drills. He was a big, beefy man with hardly any neck, although he did have a
            very large mustache. Mrs. Dursley was thin and blonde and had nearly twice the
            usual amount of neck, which came in very useful as she spent so much of her
            time craning over garden fences, spying on the neighbors. The Dursleys had a
            small son called Dudley and in their opinion there was no finer boy anywhere.
            The Dursleys had everything they wanted, but they also had a secret, and
            their greatest fear was that somebody would discover it. They didn’t think they
            could bear it if anyone found out about the Potters. Mrs. Potter was Mrs.
            Dursley’s sister, but they hadn’t met for several years; in fact, Mrs. Dursley
            pretended she didn’t have a sister, because her sister and her good-for-nothing
            husband were as unDursleyish as it was possible to be. The Dursleys shuddered
            to think what the neighbors would say if the Potters arrived in the street. The
            Dursleys knew that the Potters had a small son, too, but they had never even
            seen him. This boy was another good reason for keeping the Potters away; they
            didn’t want Dudley mixing with a child like that.
            When Mr. and Mrs. Dursley woke up on the dull, gray Tuesday our story
            starts, there was nothing about the cloudy sky outside to suggest that strange and
            mysterious things would soon be happening all over the country. Mr. Dursley
            hummed as he picked out his most boring tie for work, and Mrs. Dursley
            gossiped away happily as she wrestled a screaming Dudley into his high chair.
            None of them noticed a large, tawny owl flutter past the window.
            At half past eight, Mr. Dursley picked up his briefcase, pecked Mrs.
            Dursley on the cheek, and tried to kiss Dudley good-bye but missed, because
            Dudley was now having a tantrum and throwing his cereal at the walls.
            “Little tyke,” chortled Mr. Dursley as he left the house. He got into his car
            and backed out of number four’s drive.
